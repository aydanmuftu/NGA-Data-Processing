They have gone through the SBE processing all the way to bin averaging into 1 m bins.
These are the files on which the final versions are based (except for SKQ201915S).
NGA_TGX201904_ctd_L1_v2.zip : 73 stations bin averaged
NGA_TGX201909_ctd_L1_v2.zip : 71 stations bin averaged and an empty file
NGA_SKQ201915S_ctd_L1_v2.zip : 73 stations bin averaged (stations 50 and 51 combined to 1 file)

Version 3 files came from Liz's processing after the cruise.
They have gone through the SBE processing all the way to bin averaging into 1 m bins.
These are the files on which the final versions are based for SKQ201915S.
NGA_SKQ201915S_ctd_L1_v3.zip : 74 stations bin averaged (stations 50 and 51 not combined to 1 file)
    - fixed problem with .xmlcon file
    - used 0.1 m/s instead of 0.25 m/s  for loop edit
    - writing out SUNA and LISST so can compare SUNA to bottle data
