Provenance of the files in this directory

Version 1 files came from processing during the cruises.
Version 2 files are processed by Liz on her CTD processing PC

These files were transfered to Liz via data drives after the cruises
NGA_SKQ202110S_ctd_L1_v1.zip : 72 stations, includes .cnv and bin averaged and .ros (SUNA, no LISST)
Did not get these for SKQ202106S

These were uploaded by Liz from her PC
NGA_SKQ202106S_ctd_L1_v2.zip : 72 stations, includes .cnv and bin averaged and 59 btl (SUNA and LISST)
NGA_SKQ202110S_ctd_L1_v2.zip : 72 stations, includes .cnv and bin averaged and 58 btl (SUNA, no LISST)

For Tiglax cruise (Fall), there was no version of data processed aboard ship. From Liz's PC:
NGA_TGX202109_ctd_L1_v1.zip : 65 station, includes .cnv bin averaged and 47 btl (SUNA)
LISST was maybe collected, but I stopped writing it to the CTD files because it is
not real data.
