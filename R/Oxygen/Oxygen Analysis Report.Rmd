## Sensor vs. Winkler Comparisons

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r comparison, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(o2$Oxygen,
     o2$downcast1,
     pch = 16,
     xlab = 'Discrete Oxygen Concentration',
     ylab = 'Primary Oxygen Sensor',
     ylim = c(0,350),
     xlim = c(0,350),
     xaxs = 'i',
     yaxs = 'i')
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = 'darkgrey', lwd = 2)
grid(); box()

plot(o2$Oxygen,
     o2$downcast2,
     pch = 16,
     xlab = 'Discrete Oxygen Concentration',
     ylab = 'Secondary Oxygen Sensor',
     ylim = c(0,350),
     xlim = c(0,350),
     xaxs = 'i',
     yaxs = 'i')
abline(a = 0, b = 1)
grid(); box()


plot(o2$Oxygen,
     o2$downcast1 - o2$Oxygen,
     pch = 16,
     xlab = 'Discrete Oxygen Concentration',
     ylab = 'Primary Oxygen Difference',
     xlim = c(0,350),
     xaxs = 'i')
abline(h = 0)
grid(); box()

plot(o2$Oxygen,
     o2$downcast2 - o2$Oxygen,
     pch = 16,
     xlab = 'Discrete Oxygen Concentration',
     ylab = 'Secondary Oxygen Difference',
     xlim = c(0,350),
     xaxs = 'i')
abline(h = 0)
grid(); box()
```

### Cruise-by-Cruise

While the above compares the oxyen sensor values to discrete Winkler titrations across the entire dataset, the more important comparison is performed on a cruise-by-cruise basis. Here, the sensor values and discrete titration values are plotted for each cruise individually.

``` {r cruise-by-cruise, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

tmp = o2[!is.na(o2$downcast1),]
for (cruise in unique(tmp$Cruise)) {
  k = tmp$Cruise == cruise
  plot(tmp$Oxygen[k],
       tmp$downcast1[k],
       pch = 16,
       xlab = 'Discrete Oxygen Concentration',
       ylab = 'Primary Oxygen Sensor',
       main = cruise,
       ylim = c(0,350),
       xlim = c(0,350),
       xaxs = 'i',
       yaxs = 'i')
  abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = 'darkgrey', lwd = 2)
  grid(); box()
  
  plot(tmp$Oxygen[k],
       tmp$downcast2[k] - tmp$Oxygen[k],
       pch = 16,
       xlab = 'Discrete Oxygen Concentration',
       ylab = 'Secondary Oxygen Difference',
       xlim = c(0,350),
       xaxs = 'i')
  abline(h = 0)
  grid(); box()
  
}

```


### Primary-vs-Secondary

Deviations between the two oxygen sensors (when available) should be thoroughly inspected to identify which sensor is more consistent with discrete measurements and/or climatology of oxygen concentrations at that location.

``` {r, primary-vs-secondary, echo=FALSE}

plot(o2$downcast1, o2$downcast2,
     pch = 16,
     ylim = c(0,350),
     xlim = c(0,350),
     xaxs = 'i',
     yaxs = 'i')
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = 'darkgrey', lwd = 2)
grid(); box()

```
